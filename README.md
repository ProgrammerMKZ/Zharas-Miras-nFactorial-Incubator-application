# Zharas-Miras-nFactorial-Incubator-application
In order to run the Django project, you need to install all of the requirements viewing the file with requirements and installing them on the terminal in django project through "pip install {requirement that you need}". After that, in terminal, move to the Django project called "Events_Miras". Type "py manage.py runserver" in the terminal. The link to the local server will appear after that. Click on it and you will move to the website. Feel free to use it after that!

# Process of code writing and some unique methods, used in project.
In order to build this project, I have used Django framework. Django framework is one of the most popular backend tools used by programmers all around the world. I have implemented this framework to build a functionality of website, such as authorization, login, registration and registration to the events. I have used Figma website in order to construct aesthetic design for my website, making my work better and way more interesting. Then, I have used this design to contruct a fully functioning website on HTML/CSS. 

# How to add/delete an event
You can add an event by going to the site and typing http://127.0.0.1:8000//admin. From here, you can log in with a username "test" and password "Test12345678", go to Events and click on the button "+Add" and add new event. You can delete or view current events by pushing the button "Events" and seeing all of the events. 

# How to add/delete/view users
Logging in as user "test" and password "Test12345678", go to the "Users" and click on it. You will be able to delete/add and view all of the users. You can grant them admin permissions too.

# Restrictions
My website has two restrictions. When you register second time to the event, it won't let you cancel your registration on profile. So, DON'T REGISTER TO THE EVENT TWICE. If you do, delete the registration on admin panel, logging in as user "test" and password "Test12345678", go to the "Registration_on_events" and delete dublicating registration. Also, DON'T TRY TO ENROLL ON THE EVENT ON THE MAIN PAGE BEFORE YOU LOG IN, it will just show an error.
