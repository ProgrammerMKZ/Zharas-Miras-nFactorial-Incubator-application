In order to run the Django project, you need to install all of the requirements. After that, in terminal, move to the Django project called "Events_Miras". Type "py manage.py runserver" in the terminal. The link to the local server will appear after that. Click on it and you will move to the website. Feel free to use it after that!

# Process of code writing and some unique methods, used in project.
In order to build this project, I have used Django framework. Django framework is one of the most popular backend tools used by programmers all around the world. I have implemented this framework to build a functionality of website, such as authorization, login, registration and registration to the events. However, my website has one problem. When you register second time to the event, it won't let you cancel your registration on profile. So, DON'T REGISTER TO THE EVENT TWICE. If you do, delete the registration on admin panel, logging in as user "test" and password "Test12345678"
I have used Figma website in order to construct aesthetic design for my website, making my work better and way more interesting. Then, I have used this design to contruct a fully functioning website on HTML/CSS.
